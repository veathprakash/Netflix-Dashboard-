Netflix Dashboard
Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive Netflix Dashboard using Power BI, MySQL, and Excel. The dashboard visualizes key metrics and insights related to Netflix content, users, and performance. It tracks user engagement, content performance, regional data, and subscription trends, providing valuable insights for decision-makers.

Technologies Used
Power BI: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
MySQL: For database management and querying relevant data.
Excel: For data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis before importing into Power BI.
Key Features
User Engagement Metrics: Includes metrics like active users, churn rates, and new sign-ups.
Content Performance: Visualizes top-watched movies, series, and genre trends.
Geographic Insights: Provides data about user distribution and regional content preferences.
Subscription & Revenue Tracking: Shows subscription plan distribution and revenue trends.
Operational Metrics: Monitors streaming quality, server performance, and user satisfaction.
Files Included
Power BI (.pbix): The interactive dashboard file containing the visualizations and insights.
SQL Files (.sql): MySQL scripts used to extract and manage data for the dashboard.
Excel Files (.xlsx): Data used for data preprocessing and cleaning before importing to Power BI.
How to Run the Project
1. MySQL Setup:
Import the SQL script into your MySQL database to set up the tables and data.
Ensure your MySQL server is running, and you can access the database from Power BI.
2. Power BI Setup:
Open the .pbix Power BI file.
Connect Power BI to your MySQL database using the appropriate connection details.
Refresh the dataset to load the data and generate the visualizations.
3. Excel Data (if applicable):
Open the Excel file and review the preprocessed data.
Data can be imported directly into Power BI for further analysis if not already included in the Power BI file.
Prerequisites
MySQL: Make sure you have MySQL installed to run the SQL files.
Power BI Desktop: Required to open and interact with the .pbix file.
Excel: Optional for reviewing and working with data before importing it to Power BI.
